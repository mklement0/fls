# fls(1) - type-filtering wrapper around ls

## SYNOPSIS

A type-filtering wrapper around the standard `ls` utility.

    fls [<filter>] [<options-for-ls>] [<dir>]
    fls [<filter>] [<options-for-ls>] <fileOrDir>...

`<filter>` is a string of filter characters; commonly used are:

    f       file or symlink to file
    d       dir or symlink to dir
    L       symlink
    x       executable file / searchable dir. (by you)

Filters are combined with logical AND, and filters placed after `^` are negated.  
E.g., `fls fx^L` lists executable files that aren't symlinks.

## DESCRIPTION

`fls` is a wrapper around the `ls` utility that enables listing filesystem  
items filtered by type.

NOTE: For simplicity, this utility is limited to filtering items from a  
*single* directory:

 * Either: by specifying a single directory (the current one by default)  
   whose *content* to filter.
 * Or: as the result of globbing on the command line, by specifying multiple  
   items all from the same parent directory to filter *themselves*.  
   Unlike with `ls`, matching items are always printed by filename only, with  
   the path component, if any, removed.

To allow use of a single utility in both filtering and non-filtering  
scenarios, specifying a filter is optional and not specifying one makes  
`fls` behave like `ls`, within the constraints noted.

For convenience and to facilitate definition of aliases, the filter may be  
placed before or after the options to pass to `ls`, if any.  
A first operand that is not a valid filter is considered a file operand  
instead. If what you intended as a filter is treated as a (non-existent)  
file instead, the implicication is that the filter is invalid; to see the  
specific reason, specify the filter unambiguously, by:

 * either: placing it before options; e.g.: `fls d -l [...]`  
 * or: following it with `--`; e.g.: `fls -l d -- [...]`  

Conversely, to explicitly request unfiltered output, use `--`    
as the first operand; e.g.: `fls -- [...]`  

The exit code is 0, as long as all file operands exist and can be examined.  
Thus, a filter that matches nothing simply produces no output, without  
indicating an error condition.

## OPTIONS AND OPERANDS

  * `<options-for-ls>`  
    Options to pass through to `ls`, such as `-l` to list in long format;  
    see `man ls`.

  * `<dir>`  
    A single directory whose items (files and subdirectories) to filter;  
    defaults to `.` (the current directory).
  
  * `<fileOrDir>...`  
    A list of files and/or subdirectories from a *single* parent directory  
    to which to apply filtering *directly*.  
    Typically, this list will come from pathname expansion (globbing) on the  
    command line.  
    Note that, unlike with `ls`, option `-d` is implictly in effect for  
    multiple operands; that is, (sub)directories among the operands are always  
    filtered and printed as themselves, and their content is neither examined  
    nor printed.  
    CAVEAT: If a glob happens to expand to a *single directory*, this utility  
    will instead target that directory's *content*, as if a single directory  
    had been explicitly specified - it cannot tell the difference.  
    When in doubt, use `-d` explicitly.

  * `<filter>`  
    A string of one or more filter characters, optionally grouped by negation.  
    AND logic is implicitly applied to multiple filters; i.e., matching items  
    must meet ALL criteria.  
    A `^` preceding one or more characters negates their logic; only one `^`  
    is allowed.  
    Specifying just `--` explicitly indicates that *no* filtering should be  
    performed at all.

    Filter characters correspond to Bash's file-test operators; common ones  
    are listed below; for the full list, see CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS in  
    `man bash`.

    * `f, d`  
      match a file / directory; note that for symlinks the type of their  
      *target* is matched.  
    
    * `x`  
      matches an executable file or searchable directory; add `f` or `d` to
      distinguish.

    * `L` or `h`  
      matches a symlink. Add `f` or `d` to distinguish between symlinks to  
      files and those to directories.  
      Use `L^fdbcpS` to find broken symlinks.

    * `s`  
      matches a nonempty file (nonzero-byte file) or nonempty directory  
      Add `f` or `d` to distinguish. Note: bash's `-s` test operator only  
      operates meaningfully on files, not directories, but this utility  
      extends the "nonempty" semantics to refer to directories that contain  
      at least one item (whether hidden or not).

    * `r`, `w`  
      match a file or directory that the current user can read / write.

## TIPS

To include hidden items in the set of items to filter, use `ls`'s `-A` option;  
e.g.:

    fls d -A  # list all subdirs., including hidden ones

To filter among hidden files or directories only, use glob `.*` - this will  
return only the hidden items; e.g.:

    fls f .*  # show hidden files
    fls d .*  # show hidden subdirs.

Since remembering filter characters can be a challenge, you can define  
aliases; e.g.:

    alias lsd='fls d'     # list directories
    alias lsexe='fls xf'  # list executables
    alias lsln='fls L'    # list symlinks

The following alias wraps `fls` with a set of useful `ls` options, such as
including hidden items and using human-friendly file sizes:

    alias lsx='fls -FAhl' # fls with useful ls options baked in

## EXAMPLES

      # List all files in the current dir.
    fls f

      # List all files in the current dir in long format, including hidden ones.
    fls f -lA

      # List all hidden files in the current dir.
    fls f .*

      # List all subdirs. of /    
    fls d /

      # List all symlinks to files in the current dir.
    fls Lf

      # List all executable files matching c* in /usr/local/bin
    fls xf /usr/local/bin/c*

      # List all empty (zero bytes) files in the current dir.
    fls f^s

      # List all empty subdirs. in the current dir.
    fls d^s

      # Find broken symlinks in the current dir.
    fls L^fdbcpS

      # Use without filters.
    fls           # same as ls
    fls -lt ~     # same as ls -lt ~
    fls -lt -- ~  # ditto, explicitly requesting unfiltered output
