* **v0.1.0** (2015-06-03):
  * [dev] Version bumped to 0.1.0 to better reflect the level of maturity.
  * [doc] TOC problem fixed.

* **v0.0.2** (2015-06-03):
  * [fix] Simple, but fundamental bug on Linux fixed (my apologies): no longer tries to use `command` with `exec`, which fails on Linux, because `command` is only a builtin (and was never needed to begin with).

* **v0.0.1** (2015-06-03):
  * Initial release.
