# SYNOPSIS
#     indexOf needle "${haystack[@]}"
# *Via stdout*, returns the zero-based index of a string element in an array of strings or -1, if not found.
# The *return code* indicates if the element was found or not.
# EXAMPLE
#   a=('one' 'two' 'three')
#   ndx=$(indexOf 'two' "${a[@]}") # -> $ndx is now 1

# SYNOPSIS
#   isIn needle "${haystack[@]}"
# Indicates via *exit code only* if string NEEDLE is contained in array HAYSTACK.
# EXAMPLE
#  a=('one' 'two' 'three')
#  isIn 'two' "${a[@]}" && echo "contained"
isIn() { indexOf "$@" >/dev/null; }

# SYNOPSIS
#   intersection list1 list2 [sep [outsep]]
# Returns the - sorted - intersection of tokens in 2 input lists.
# SEP is the separator used to separate tokens in the input list, OUTSEP the separator to use when printg the results.
# SEP defaults to a newline, and OUTSEP to the value of SEP.
# If SEP is explicitly given as the empty string, the input lists are broken into individual *characters*.
# Note that any nonempty result will have a trailing instance of OUTSEP.
# CAVEATS:
#   - NOT LOCALE-AWARE on OSX: both awk and sort do not deal properly with UTF-8 encoded non-ASCII characters.
#   - This function is expensive, because external utilities are called multiple times: to tokenize, sort, and compare
# EXAMPLES:
#   intersection hello world '' # -> 'lo' (the sorted list of chars. that 'hello' and 'world' have in common)

#   isEmpty dirOrFile
# DESCRIPTION
#   Indicates if the specified file or directory is fully empty (exit code 0) or not (exit code 1).
#   Note that if the argument is a symlink, the empty test invariably applies to the link's TARGET.
#   The file or directory must exist, otherwise an error message is printed and the exit code is set to 3.
#   - For files, empty means: a size of 0 bytes.
#   - For directories, empty means: it must not contain any files or subdirectories, whether hidden or not.
# EXAMPLE
#  isEmpty ~/Applications && echo "~/Applications is completely empty."

#  Markdown formatting tips:

#   - HEADINGS
#     - For better plain-text rendering, leave an empty line after a heading
#       marked-man will remove it from the ROFF version.
#     - The first heading must be a level-1 heading containing the utility
#       name and very brief description; append the manual-section number 
#       directly to the CLI name; e.g.:
#         # foo(1) - does bar
#     - The 2nd, level-2 heading must be '## SYNOPSIS' and the chapter's body
#       must render reasonably as plain text, because it is printed to stdout
#       when  `-h`, `--help` is specified:
#         Use 4-space indentation without markup for both the syntax line and the
#         block of brief option descriptions; represent option-arguments and operands
#         in angle brackets; e.g., '<foo>'
#     - All other headings should be level-2 headings in ALL-CAPS.
#   - TEXT
#      - Use NO indentation for regular chapter text; if you do, it will 
#        be indented further than list items.
#      - Use 4-space indentation, as usual, for code blocks.
#      - Markup character-styling markup translates to ROFF rendering as follows:
#         `...` and **...** render as bolded (red) text
#         _..._ and *...* render as word-individually underlined text
#   - LISTS
#      - Indent list items by 2 spaces for better plain-text viewing, but note
#        that the ROFF generated by marked-man still renders them unindented.
#      - End every list item (bullet point) itself with 2 trailing spaces too so
#        that it renders on its own line.
#      - Avoid associating more than 1 paragraph with a list item, if possible,
#        because it requires the following trick, which hampers plain-text readability:
#        Use '&nbsp;<space><space>' in lieu of an empty line.

# fls(1) - type-filtering wrapper around ls

## SYNOPSIS

A type-filtering wrapper around the standard `ls` utility.

    fls [<filter>] [<options-for-ls>] [<dir>]
    fls [<filter>] [<options-for-ls>] <fileOrDir>...

`<filter>` is a string of filter characters; commonly used are:

    f       file or symlink to file
    d       dir or symlink to dir
    l       symlink
    x       executable file / searchable dir. (by you)
    e       empty file (zero bytes) or empty dir. (no files or subdirs.)

Filters are combined with logical AND, and filters placed after `^` are negated.  
E.g., `fls fx^l` lists executable files that aren't symlinks.

Standard options: `--help`, `--man`, `--version`, `--home`

## DESCRIPTION

`fls` is a wrapper around the `ls` utility that enables listing filesystem  
items filtered by type and certain attributes.

NOTE: For simplicity, this utility is limited to filtering items from a  
*single* directory:

 * Either: by specifying a single directory (the current one by default)  
   whose *content* to filter.
 * Or: as the result of globbing on the command line, by specifying multiple  
   items all from the same parent directory to filter *themselves*.  
   Unlike with `ls`, matching items are always printed by filename only, with  
   the path component, if any, removed.

To allow use of a single utility in both filtering and non-filtering  
scenarios, specifying a filter is optional and not specifying one makes  
`fls` behave like `ls`, within the constraints noted.

For convenience and to facilitate definition of aliases, the filter may be  
placed before or after the options to pass to `ls`, if any.  
A first operand that is not a valid filter is considered a file operand  
instead. If what you intended as a filter is treated as a (non-existent)  
file instead, the implicication is that the filter is invalid; to see the  
specific reason, specify the filter unambiguously, by:

 * either: placing it before options; e.g.: `fls d -l [...]`  
 * or: following it with `--`; e.g.: `fls -l d -- [...]`  

Conversely, to explicitly request unfiltered output, use `--`    
as the first operand; e.g.: `fls -- [...]`  

The exit code is 0, as long as all file operands exist and can be examined.  
Thus, a filter that matches nothing simply produces no output, without  
indicating an error condition.

## OPTIONS AND OPERANDS

  * `<options-for-ls>`  
    Options to pass through to `ls`, such as `-l` to list in long format;  
    see `man ls`.

  * `<dir>`  
    A single directory whose items (files and subdirectories) to filter;  
    defaults to `.` (the current directory).
  
  * `<fileOrDir>...`  
    A list of files and/or subdirectories from a *single* parent directory  
    to which to apply filtering *directly*.  
    Typically, this list will come from pathname expansion (globbing) on the  
    command line.  
    Note that, unlike with `ls`, option `-d` is implictly in effect for  
    multiple operands; that is, (sub)directories among the operands are always  
    filtered and printed as themselves, and their content is neither examined  
    nor printed.  
    CAVEAT: If a glob happens to expand to a *single directory*, this utility  
    will instead target that directory's *content*, as if a single directory  
    had been explicitly specified - it cannot tell the difference.  
    When in doubt, use `-d` explicitly.

  * `<filter>`  
    A filter expression to apply to the set of input files an subdirs so that  
    only items matching the filter are output.  
    A filter expression is composed of a string of one or more filters, each  
    of which is represented by a single character detailed in the next chapter.  
    AND logic is implicitly applied to multiple filters; i.e., matching items  
    must meet ALL criteria.  
    A `^` preceding one or more filters negates their logic; only one `^`  
    is allowed.  
    Specifying just `--` explicitly indicates that *no* filtering should be  
    performed at all.

## FILTERS

Individual filters are characters that are a subset of the type-identifying  
chars. accepted by `find`'s `-type` primary and Bash's file-test  
operators, with some custom modifications and extensions, where noted.

Note that with the exception of `l`, all tests are applied to the targets of  
symlinks, not the symlinks themselves.

### TYPE Filters

  * `f` matches a regular file.

  * `d` matches a directory.

  * `l` matches a symlink; add `f` or `d` to distinguish between symlinks to  
    files and those to directories; see the TIPS chapter for how to find  
    broken symlinks.  
    NOTE: The equivalent Bash operators are `L` or `h`, which are also  
    accepted.

  * `b`, `c`, `p`, `s` match a block special file, character special file,  
    a named pipe (FIFO), and a socket, respectively.  
    NOTE: Bash uses `S` to test for a socket, and `s` to test for nonempty  
    files; this utility instead uses `e` to test for emptiness - see below.  
    `S` is, however, also accepted by this utility to test for sockets.
  
### ATTRIBUTE Filters

  * `x` matches a file that the current user can execute or a directory that  
    the current user can search; add `f` or `d` to distinguish.

  * `e` matches an empty file (zero bytes) or empty directory; add `f` or `d`  
    to distinguish. A directory is only considered empty if it truly contains  
    no items, whether hidden or not.  
    NOTE: Bash offers operator `-s`, which uses opposite semantics (test for  
    non-emptiness) and applies to files only; using `s` that way is NOT  
    supported by this utility, because it clashes with using `s` to test for  
    a socket, but you can use `f^e` to emulate it.

  * `r`, `w` matches a file or directory that the current user can read / write.

The following, less common Bash filters are supported as well:
   
  * `u` matches if the item's set-user-id permissions bit is set.
  * `g` matches if the item's set-group-id permissions bit is set.
  * `k` matches if the item's sticky permissions bit is set.
  * `G` matches if the item is owned by the effective group ID.
  * `N` matches if the item has been modified since it was last read.
  * `O` matches if the item is owned by the effective user ID.

## TIPS

To include hidden items in the set of items to filter, use `ls`'s `-A` option;  
e.g.:

    fls d -A  # list all subdirs., including hidden ones

To filter among hidden files or directories only, use glob `.*` - this will  
return only the hidden items; e.g.:

    fls f .*  # show hidden files
    fls d .*  # show hidden subdirs.

To find broken (dangling) symlinks, use:

    fls l^fdbcps

Since remembering filter characters can be a challenge, you can define  
aliases; e.g.:

    alias lsd='fls d'     # list directories
    alias lsexe='fls xf'  # list executables
    alias lsln='fls L'    # list symlinks

The following alias wraps `fls` with a set of useful `ls` options, such as  
including hidden items and using human-friendly file sizes:

    alias lsx='fls -FAhl' # fls with useful ls options baked in

      # List all files in the current dir in long format, including hidden ones.
    fls f -lA

      # List all hidden files in the current dir.
    fls f .*

      # List all subdirs. of /    
    fls d /

      # List all symlinks to files in the current dir.
    fls lf

      # List all executable files matching c* in /usr/local/bin
    fls xf /usr/local/bin/c*

      # List all empty (zero bytes) files in the current dir.
    fls fe

      # List all empty subdirs. in the current dir.
    fls de

      # Find broken symlinks in the current dir.
    fls l^fdbcps

      # Use without filters.
    fls         # same as ls
    fls -lt ~   # same as ls -lt ~
    fls -- pg   # same as ls pg, -- unambiguously marks pg as file operand
